## This is a personal exercize project where I try to emulate an existing webpage with raw HTML and CSS.

The challenge is to:
  - follow the original creator's design choices without relying on the frameworks the site was built in
  - make the site similarily responsive
  - write a DRY and clean code, simplifying as much as possible
